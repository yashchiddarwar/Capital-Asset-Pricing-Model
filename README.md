This is a project that implements the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) using Python. The CAPM is a financial model that estimates the expected return of an investment based on its risk compared to the overall market. It is widely used in finance and investment analysis.

## Description

The CAPM Project provides a user-friendly interface to calculate and analyze the expected returns of different securities using the CAPM formula. This project utilizes the following libraries:

- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, such as reading and processing financial data.
- **NumPy**: Provides support for mathematical operations and array manipulation required for the CAPM calculations.
- **Plotly**: Enables interactive and visually appealing data visualization, allowing users to explore and interpret the results.
- **Streamlit**: Facilitates the creation of a web application that showcases the CAPM calculations and visualizations in an accessible manner.

## Formula

The CAPM formula calculates the expected return of an investment as follows:

```
Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate)
```

where:
- **Risk-Free Rate**: The rate of return on a risk-free investment, such as a government bond.
- **Beta**: The measure of the investment's sensitivity to market movements.
- **Market Return**: The expected return of the overall market.

## Installation

To use this project, you can clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Capital-Asset-Pricing-Model.git
```

## Usage

To run the CAPM project, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run CAPM_Return.py
```

This will start the application and provide you with a user-friendly interface to input the necessary parameters and visualize the results using Plotly.
